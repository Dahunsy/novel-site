               <h3>More Rules for Interactions</h3>
               <p>Due to the fact that thousands of people of different religions and beliefs interact on the website, and all of them are full-fledged members of our community, we need to stipulate rules for the interactions that would occur over the duration of using the service.</p>
               <p>We strongly recommend that you read these rules. It will take just one or two minutes, but it will save you and our time and will help make the website more welcoming and organized.</p>
               <p>Firstly, behave respectfully to all visitors to our website. Do not insult other readers, it is always unwanted and never fun.</p>
               <p>If you have a complaint, contact administrators or moderators (report it through the "complaint system" or use personal messages). We consider insulting other visitors one of the most serious violations and it is severely punished by the Administration.</p>
               <p>The following are also strictly prohibited:
                   <ul>
                       <li>	Racism</li>
                       <li>	hate speech, insults and threats to other visitors as well as religious, sexual or political discussions</li>
                       <li>	messages and comments not related to the content of the novel or the context of the discussion</li>
                       <li>	expressions that contain profanity, that are degrading, or that incite ethnic strife</li>
                       <li>	abuse of site functions (cheating stats, cyberbullying etc)</li>
                       <li>	sale of an account or transfer of access to third parties</li>
                       <li>	spam and advertising of any goods and services, media or events, or other resources not related to discussing the novel</li>
                   </ul>
               </p>
               <p>The Administration reserves the right to remove comments, or comment parts if they do not meet these requirements. Let us respect each other and this site where you and other readers come to talk and express your thoughts.</p>
               <p>If you violate the rules, you may be given a warning. In some cases, you may be banned without warning. Contact the Administration regarding ban removal.</p>
               <p>Insulting administrators and moderators are also punished by a ban — Respect other people’s labour.</p>
